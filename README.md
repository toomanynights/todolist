At last, you can leave your map alone and keep your shopping list where it belongs: in a To-Do List interface.

# List of features

-   A simple toggle-able interface with its own left panel button.
-   Ticked items get grayed out and go to the bottom of the list.
-   Unticked items return to their original position in the list.
-   Separate button that removes ticked items.
-   Supports multi-line items.
-   Configurable hotkeys for most actions.
    

# "To-Do List" to-do list *

This is a working complete mod. I do realize that a few more things could be done with it - however, I'd like you to be the judge of what (if any) feature it lacks the most.

The poll is available here: https://tally.so/r/mYW855

I will prioritize whatever is most voted for. However, there is no guarantee that I'll implement all features from the poll, or any at all - as the mod is very usable as it is.

You can also suggest features in the comments if they are not in the poll.

 <sub>\* I did the whole thing pretty much exclusively for this joke, so you gotta appreciate it!</sub>

# "To-Do List" won't-do list

-   *Strike-through the ticked items* - not possible due to lack of this format in PZ engine.
-   *Close "New task" UI with Esc* - I didn't find how to make it work. But you can close that dialogue with Enter if the field is empty.

# List of compatibility notes

-   Make sure you install the [Simple UI library](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2760035814) - the mod won't work without it.    
-   The mod is done with compatibility in mind, so I don't anticipate any issues.
-   However, if some other mod changes the left panel, there may be problems due to how left panel changes are handled by the game. Please let me know about the problem.
-   Safe to add or remove mid-save.
-   Supports UI scaling.
-   Supports MP.
-   Does not support gamepad.

# List of special thanks

-   MrBounty - for the awesome [SimpleUI library](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2760035814). Even though it leaves [a lot](https://github.com/MrBounty/PZ-UI_API/issues) to be desired, I don't think I'd ever be able to conquer Zomboid UI without it.
-   Poltergeist - for his amazing auto translation tool that I believe every PZ modder should use.
-   Burryaga - for the enormous stream of wisdom he's been sending my way, as well as the scrupulous code review. Modders together strong.
-   You - if you like, subscribe and/or favorite this mod.
-   You again - if you choose the last option in the [poll](https://tally.so/r/mYW855).
